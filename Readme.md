## Audience

- Beginners to Generative AI and RAG
- Developers, data engineers, and solution architects seeking practical, hands-on experience
- Anyone interested in building AI-powered applications with Azure

## Duration

**Recommended:** 2 days (3 labs per day)
- **Day 1:** Azure AI Foundations & RAG Basics (Lab 1-3)
- **Day 2:** Advanced RAG & AI Agents (Lab 4-6)

## Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop participants will be able to:

- Create and configure Azure AI services (Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search)
- Build text-generating applications using Azure OpenAI
- Understand and implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) concepts
- Develop chatbots with document retrieval capabilities
- Create production-ready RAG applications with web interfaces
- Build and deploy AI agents using Azure AI Foundry

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An active Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended extensions: Azure Account, Azure CLI Tools, Python)
- Git for cloning the repository
- Basic familiarity with Python and command line

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Azure subscription
- [ ] Azure CLI installed and logged in
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] VS Code installed
- [ ] Git installed

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd genai-labs

# Open in VS Code
code .
```

Each lab folder contains an `example.env` file. Copy it to `.env` and update with your Azure credentials before running the code.
