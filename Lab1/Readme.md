# Lab 1: Explore Azure AI Services


Welcome to Lab 1! 

In this lab, you'll see how AI can read documents automatically - no coding needed!


## 🎯 Lab Objectives#

### Step 1: Open the Website

By the end of this lab, you will:By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Go to: **https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio**

2. Click **"Try it out"** (no login needed!)- Understand what Azure AI Document Intelligence can do- Explore Azure AI Foundry portal (unified AI services interface)



### Step 2: Try Reading an Invoice- Extract text and tables from any document using Layout model- Explore Azure Document Intelligence for document processing



1. Click on **"Invoice"**- Extract structured data from invoices automatically- Explore Azure AI Language for text analysis

2. You'll see a sample invoice on the screen

3. Click the **"Analyze"** button- Extract information from receipts- Explore Azure AI Speech for speech-to-text and text-to-speech

4. Wait 3 seconds...

5. **Look at the results!** AI found:- See real-world use cases for document automation- Explore Azure AI Vision for image analysis

   - Company name

   - Invoice number- Understand the different Azure AI services available

   - Date

   - All the items and prices## 📋 Prerequisites

   - Total amount



**Why this is cool**: Normally someone types all this by hand. AI does it in 3 seconds!- Web browser



## ✅ You're Done!

4. You'll see the main page with different prebuilt models2. Or directly visit: [https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices/vision](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices/vision)



## Next Lab
Continue to Lab 2: [Text Generating Apps](../Lab2/Readme.md)

- **Solution**: Most demos work without sign-in. If required, use your Azure account credentials

## 📚 Additional Resources

**Issue**: Upload limits on demo files

- [Document Intelligence Studio](https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio)- **Solution**: Use smaller files or provided sample files for demos

- [Azure Document Intelligence Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview)

- [Document Intelligence Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-model-overview)**Issue**: Some features require Azure subscription

- [Prebuilt Models Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-invoice)- **Solution**: Many features have free demos. For full features, you'll need an active Azure subscription



## ➡️ Next Steps**Issue**: Browser compatibility

- **Solution**: Use latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox for best experience

Now that you've explored Azure Document Intelligence and seen how AI can process documents, you're ready to build applications using Azure OpenAI!
